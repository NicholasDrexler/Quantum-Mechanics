# Quantum-Mechanics
Visualizations of Quantum Wave Functions. Written in Python. 
This is an ongoing pet project which I will devote more time to in the future. 

This is a collection of python written code to visualize quantum wavefunctions and their corresponding energies for various geometric potential wells.
